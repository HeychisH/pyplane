Instructions for building the Windows executable using PyInstaller 3.3.1 on Python 3.8.8

1. Make sure PyInstaller 4.2 is installed in your Python environment!

2. Make sure that build_dir is not opened in any application or console, i.e.,
   it can be deleted by the script.
   
3. Run build_exe.py

4. The resulting exe should be found in build_dir\PyPlane.

5. If some modules are not found after launching the exe you have to manually
   import them using the hidden-import option in PyPlane.spec. This can be
   a time-consuming trial and error procedure.
   
6. Open the file InstallerPyPlane.nsi, adjust the version information if required, and run the
   file through NullSoft Installable System. Setup.exe will be placed into build_dir.
