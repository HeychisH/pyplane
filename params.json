{"name":"Pyplane","tagline":"Phase plane analysis of second order nonlinear systems","body":"# About\r\nPyPlane is a tool for the analysis of second order nonlinear dynamic systems, i.e. for systems the dynamics of which are described by two nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations. Pyplane provides the following features:\r\n* Plotting of the corresponding vector field\r\n* Plotting on forward and backward solutions from arbitrary initial conditions in the phase plane\r\n* Plotting of the time dependent solutions\r\n* Determination of equilibrium points and calculation of the corresponding Jacobians\r\n* Plotting of selected functions into the phase plane area (i.e. contour lines of Ljapunov-Functions)\r\n![](https://github.com/TUD-RST/pyplane/blob/master/resources/pyplane_logo.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
